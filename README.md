## ALS-BayesianGLM-paper

Code for the paper, “Surface-based spatial Bayesian GLM reveals complex trajectories of motor neurodegeneration in ALS” 
by Amanda F. Mejia, Vincent Koppelmans, Laura Jelsone-Swain, Sanjay Kalra, and Robert C. Welsh.


### Analysis scripts

1. `1_run_GLMs.R` -- Code to run Bayesian GLM for all subjects in the study. Imaging data for one subject is provided in the repository due to Github storage constraints.  Imaging data for all subjects is available upon request. Summary statistics are provided for all subjects to reproduce final figures in the paper.
2. `2_make_images.R` -- Code to generate surface-based images of estimates and areas of activation.
3. `3_make_plots.R` -- Code to fit longitudinal mixed effects models and generate final plots.


### Data

Imaging data for healthy control subject C07, including surface-projected task fMRI data and surface geometry models.

Additional data for all subjects required for reproducing final figures.


### Results

Summary results for all subjects required for reproducing final figures.
